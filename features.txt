on registering:
    add-in prevents you from registering on a sheet that isn't completely empty
    add-in can detect old template and will not load the add-in

on changes:
    changes are detecting by reading only the area that you changed, not the entire sheet at once.
    changes in un-authorized places(such as a non-input, or area to the right of the table) get overridden, but other changes with remain as the user pasted them
    changes to an input will only mark dependent sections as needing to re-calculate

on processing:
    when process is pressed on the sections that need it will be updated.
    when processing the cursor gets locked in place to prevent the user from making changes during that time
    

general:
    A template can now have "settings" which get saved and loaded from the metadata section of the file
    totals are now be static values not formulas
    problems with filtering and sorting should be fixed

easy functions for:
    aliasing a column into another sheet
    summing two or more columns into another
    averaging two or more columns into another
    validating input on a column
